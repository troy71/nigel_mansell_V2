    <h2>About</h2>

    <div class="write_up">
        <p>Nigel Ernest James Mansell, born on 8th August 1953, is a British former racing driver, who competed in
            Formula
            One
            from 1980 to 1995. Mansell won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 1992 with Williams, and won 31
            Grands
            Prix across 15 seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Mansell won the IndyCar World Series in 1993 with
            Newman/Haas
            Racing, and remains the only driver to have simultaneously held both the World Drivers' Championship and the
            American open-wheel National Championship.</p>

        <p>His career in Formula One spanned 15 seasons, with his final two full seasons of top-level racing being spent
            in
            the
            CART series. Mansell was the reigning F1 champion when he moved to CART, becoming the first person to win
            the
            CART
            title in his debut season, and making him the only person to hold both the World Drivers' Championship and
            the
            American open-wheel National Championship simultaneously. Mansell is the second most successful British
            Formula
            One
            driver of all time in terms of race wins with 31 victories, behind Lewis Hamilton with 105 wins, and is
            eighth
            overall on the Formula One race winners list, behind Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, Max Verstappen, Sebastian
            Vettel,
            Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Fernando Alonso. He held the record for the most pole positions set in a
            single
            season, which was broken in 2011 by Sebastian Vettel. He also remains the last Formula One driver to win a
            race
            over
            the age of 40, which was the 1994 Australian Grand Prix.</p>

        <p>Mansell raced in the Grand Prix Masters series in 2005, and won the championship title. He later signed a
            one-off
            race deal for the Scuderia Ecosse GT race team to drive their number 63 Ferrari F430 GT2 car at Silverstone
            on 6
            May
            2007. He has since competed in additional sports car races with his sons Leo and Greg, including the 2010 24
            Hours
            of Le Mans, and was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2005.</p>
